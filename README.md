# News Classifier
Classifier of news articles via Machine Learning (word embedding and LSTM).

Natural Language Processing models for document classification tasks. 

I used a baseline model via a pre-trained 50 dimensional word-embedding representation and a LSTM model 

Data: trained the two models on a BBC archive of 2225 news articles (Kaggle). 

The LSTM model reached 89% accuracy on the test set.
